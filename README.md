## 2.1 [AA 203: Optimal and Learning-Based Control](https://stanfordasl.github.io/aa203/)

> Optimal control solution techniques for systems with known and unknown dynamics. Dynamic programming, Hamilton-Jacobi reachability, and direct and indirect methods for trajectory optimization. Introduction to model predictive control. Adaptive control, model-based and model-free reinforcement learning, and connections between modern reinforcement learning and fundamental optimal control ideas.



## 2.2 [Reinforcement learning and optimal control for robotics (ROB-GY 6323)](http://bulletin.engineering.nyu.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=15&coid=38033)
> What kind of movements should a robot perform in order to walk, jump or manipulate objects? Can it compute optimal behaviors online? Can it learn this directly from trial and error? This course will introduce modern methods for robotics movement generation based on numerical optimal control and reinforcement learning. It will cover fundamental topics in numerical optimal control (Bellman equations, differential dynamic programming, model predictive control) and reinforcement learning (actor-critic algorithms, model-based reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement learning) applied to robotics. It will also contain hands-on exercises for real robotic applications such as walking and jumping, object manipulation or acrobatic drones. Recommended background in at least one of the following: linear systems; robotics; machine learning; convex optimization; programming (python).

## 4.1 [Stanford Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/)

> The Autonomous Systems Lab (ASL) develops methodologies for the analysis, design, and control of autonomous systems, with a particular emphasis on large-scale robotic networks and autonomous aerospace vehicles. The lab, comprised of 18 researchers, combines expertise from control theory, robotics, optimization, and operations research to develop the theoretical foundations for networked autonomous systems operating in uncertain, rapidly-changing, and potentially adversarial environments. Our work has been recognized with several awards, including a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers.
